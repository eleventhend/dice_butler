#Dice Butler
Buttling dice since June 2015

##Contents

Currently only contains a single HTML page, javascript file, and css file.


##Functionality

Dice Butler currently provides dice rolls for custom sizes/iterations/modifiers, using psuedorandom number generation. While not true random, this will more than suffice for any casual tabletop gaming experience (an even and essentially unpredictable distribution of results)

The "attack" dice roller allows the user to easily add Smite damage and relevant modifiers to the roll.

##Future Releases
We are working towards adding:

- Additional common abilities and modifiers to attacks
- Ability to save a custom roll
- Multiple saved custom rolls
